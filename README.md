# GHETTOGROUPO

## Project Description

GhettoGroup aims at providing a single platform for a large group of audience by taking inspiration from Google Classroom, Google Forms, Kahoot and Trello Cards. It focuses on and encourages shared work environments with efficient team management. It targets groups of people both academic and non academic and also individuals who are willing to work on/find open source projects. Currently it only supports `Pubic` and `Private` groups but we plan developing this project on a full scale very soon.
\
P.S: This project is still at a very early stage and has a lot of scope for improvement.

## Test the project

#### Steps to setup evironment

Create a virtualenv with python3.8
> pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Steps to setup Postgres

  *Linux*:
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib
> sudo su - postgres
> createuser --interactive --pwprompt
> role name: ghetto
> role password: ghetto
  (if prompted for superuser choose yes)
>createdb -O ghetto Ghetto

*Windows*:
  Use this link for installing it:
  https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
  You can use PgAdmin to create the new user and the database with the same credentials as above.

##### Database dump and restore

For Windows, you can use PgAdmin directly.

###### Linux Dump

  > psql ghetto > dump.sql

###### Linux Restore

  > psql ghetto < dumo.sql

#### Run migrations and create superuser

> python manage.py makemigrations
> python manage.py migrate
> python manage.py createsuperuser
> python manage.py runserver

#### Create dummy data

Since this project is not live, we are using Test API Keys for the consumed APIs. So create dummy subscriptions or directly create the groups to check other functionalities.
`_baseurl_/api/docs` has a detailed API documentation
